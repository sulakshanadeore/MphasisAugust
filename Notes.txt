Object is the base of all the classes in the framework hierarchy.
object class is available under System
(FCL/BCL) Sytem.Object

Every  class in C# inherits from Object class.
If a class is not inheriting any other class then its a direct child of Object class and it inherits some other class then it indirectly inherits from Object Class.
Purpose: Provide low-level services to derived classes.

2-->Value types & Reference types

By using System.ValueType class, the value types inherit the object class implicitly.


struct In32:ValueType:Object
------------------------------------------------

1) C# classes dont require to declare inheritance from the object class, as inheritance is implicit
2) every method in the object is available to all the children
3) Derived classes can and do override the following methods of the Object class
(ToString,Finalize,Equals,GetHashCode)
4) Avoid using object type unnecessarily as it costs performance(slower performance)
